# OFFBRAND Demo
The site [Offbrand](https://offbrand.gg) looks dope. So I "recreated" it. Obviously it isn't an *exact* replica, because that would be lame. Any old fart can wget a website. So I recreated it using Astro, because that seemed fun. This took about 4 days.

## Notes
The video displayed in the hero is straight off Offbrand's website. IDK how to edit like that (yet). Some of the literal text is from their site as well. Otherwise I came up with all the other resources (some of the icons & fonts are Google).
